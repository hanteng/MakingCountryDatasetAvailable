# MakingCountryDatasetAvailable

Making Country Dataset Available is the 2023 incubation project that explores the integrated data analytics and data science skills required for telling data stories using world data (countries/regions as unit of analysis), following the [Oxford's Our World in Data (OWID)](https://ourworldindata.org/about) great [data visualization and curation work](https://ourworldindata.org/).  

## The 2023 goals

The main goals are as follows:

* Documenting the data cleaning, aggregation, visualization tutorials to help other aspiring data journalists, data analysts, and data scientists to leverage the use of the [country convert](https://github.com/konstantinstadler/country_converter), and other [country code](https://github.com/datasets/country-codes) resources.
* Coordinating collaboration projects, particularly in the areas of global value chains, [CO2 and Greenhouse Gas Emissions](https://github.com/owid/co2-data), global power, development and freedom. 
 * Advancing the popularization of the data literacy on the use of [Multi-Regional Input-Output Analysis in Python](https://github.com/konstantinstadler/pymrio) for the green digital transformation of global value chains, carbon emission development, etc.

## Inspirations

* [Oxford's Our World in Data (OWID)](https://github.com/owid)
* [Measuring progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals: SDG tracker by OWID](https://sdg-tracker.org/)
* [country_converter](https://github.com/konstantinstadler/country_converter) and [pymrio](https://github.com/konstantinstadler/pymrio) by Konstantin Stadler

## Tutorial examples to follow

* [A Complete Guide to an Interactive Geographical Map using Python](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-complete-guide-to-an-interactive-geographical-map-using-python-f4c5197e23e0) by Shivangi Patel
